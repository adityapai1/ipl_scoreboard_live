# IPL Scoreboard Liveüèè
Revolutionizing Cricket Fan Experience with Real-Time, Data-Driven Insights



## Objective
The dynamic nature of cricket matches coupled with limited access to comprehensive, real-time data often leaves fans with a fragmented and incomplete understanding of the game.
This groundbreaking project developed a cutting-edge cricket live score dashboard that delivers an unparalleled fan experience. By ingeniously overcoming the limitations of free tier API usage, the project harnessed the power of data engineering and visualization to create a dynamic, interactive platform.
## Key Innovations
* API Optimization: Employed advanced data manipulation techniques to extract maximum value from limited API requests, ensuring continuous data flow and real-time updates.
* Data Transformation Magic: Masterfully transformed raw data into actionable insights through meticulous preprocessing, unpivoting, filtering, and data modeling, creating a robust data foundation.
* Interactive Visual Storytelling: Designed a visually stunning and intuitive dashboard that seamlessly integrates multiple data elements, providing fans with a holistic view of the match.
## Data Source

## Features

## API Constraints
The limitations of the free tier API allowed a hard limit of 100 requests/day, and 5 requests/sec. To combat this limitation in a real world scenario with much more requests, the project uses data modelling by using a reference of the fetched data.
## Impact
* Enhanced Fan Engagement: Immersed fans in the heart of the action with real-time score updates, player performance metrics, and interactive visualizations.
* Data-Driven Insights: Empowered fans to make informed decisions and predictions based on comprehensive match data and analysis.
* Innovative Technology Showcase: Demonstrated exceptional proficiency in data engineering, API utilization, and data visualization, setting a new benchmark for sports analytics.


This project represents a significant leap forward in leveraging technology to enhance the cricket fan experience. By delivering a real-time, data-driven platform, it has redefined how fans consume and engage with the game.
