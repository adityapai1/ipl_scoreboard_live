Revolutionizing Cricket Fan Experience with Real-Time, Data-Driven Insights



## Objective
The dynamic nature of cricket matches coupled with limited access to comprehensive, real-time data often leaves fans with a fragmented and incomplete understanding of the game.
This project emerged from the need for a crisp and informative dashboard that will make it possible for cricket geeks to analye the live matches and their stats. The project harnessed the power of data engineering and visualization to create a dynamic, interactive platform.

## Key Innovations
* API Optimization: Employed advanced data manipulation techniques to extract maximum value from limited API requests, ensuring continuous data flow and real-time updates.
* Data Transformation: Masterfully transformed raw data into useful insights through preprocessing, unpivoting, filtering, and data modeling, creating a robust data foundation.
* Interactive Visual Storytelling: Designed a visually stunning and intuitive dashboard that seamlessly integrates multiple data elements, providing fans with a holistic view of the match.
  
## Data Source 
[CricBuzz API (Rapid API)](https://rapidapi.com/cricketapilive/api/cricbuzz-cricket/playground/apiendpoint_289380b9-1ae3-4679-932b-2d0666a20083)
#### API Constraints
The limitations of the free tier API allowed a hard limit of 100 requests/day, and 5 requests/sec. To combat this limitation in a real world scenario with much more requests, the project uses data modelling by using a reference of the fetched data.
